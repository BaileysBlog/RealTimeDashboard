# Real Time Dashboard
I want to do something that involves WebSockets, .Net, Angular and has something of value.
So I have decided that I'd create a dashboard that shows simple graphs and numbers in real-time from a .Net SignalR server.
Dashboard Screen:
- Server CPU usage on graph
- Server Memory usage on graph
- Number of connected WebSockets
-- Number of other people also watching the statistics
- Size of the database being used to store this information
- Potentially other information from the database
